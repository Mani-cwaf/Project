            Sustainability means our ability to maintain or support a process continuously over time. Our theme, “Sustainable Cities,” sheds light on the practices that we, as citizens of our cities, our country, and this planet at large, can follow to make life more sustainable on Earth.
            <br> <br> The “Sustainable cities” project seeks to bring awareness, inspire, and strengthen attitudes, behaviours, and lifestyles that prevent the depletion of natural resources. 
            <br> <br> Two of the most substantial sustainable strategies are—reducing environmental footprint and conserving resources, for example, cutting emissions, lowering energy usage, disposing of responsibly, etc.</p>
